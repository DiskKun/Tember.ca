		<h1>Advear</h1>
		<h2>Current development stage: Alpha</h2>
		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>In the future, government researchers with the technology allowing them to look into any moment in the past notice an anomaly that occured some odd 500 years ago: for exactly nine seconds, the inhabitants of the country <b>Advear</b> vanished, and then returned. No historical records documented this event, implying that someone (or something!) has been tampering with the past.</p>
		<p>You have been assigned the special operatives task of travelling back in time using experimental technology to investigate the incident. There's only one problem: your time machine is only accurate enough to let you visit one year before the incident, and one year after.</p>
		<h2>The Adverian Language</h2>
		<p>The written (and spoken!) language of the Adverians will be a fully realized language with a unique alphabet and grammer. I'm developing this language myself, and it will be a major part of the game. The game's manual will teach you how to read the language and translate various texts. In the game, the Adverians do not speak English very well. Some are fluent, some speak it in broken parts, and some will strictly speak Adverian. Knowing the language will be important to the game</p>
		<h2>About the Game</h2>
		<p>Advear was originally going to be a browser-based HTML5 game. I decided that I would rather make it in assembly for the Nintendo Game Boy, so that's what I'm doing. In the <i>very</i> early stages of development, the game was open source. However, I have since decided to close the source. Since I plan on releasing the game on a physical Game Boy cartridge, I plan on including the source code in said package.</p>
		<p>The game is not finished. The release date is uncertain. I understand that it is an ambitious project. I suspect that it will take me years to complete, as I have to juggle school, work, and other various bothers (:P) in order to find time to work on the game. Anyways, it will release when it's done. Be patient.</p>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>I've been documenting my development process on my <a href="https://discord.gg/nuuCdYSRGf">Discord</a> server. If you want to follow the process, please feel free to join us there. I talk about the game, it's story, and the various programming techniques I'm using. I'm learning the language as I go, and I understand the risks of doing so. I expect that at some point, I'll have to scrap all of my work and start from scratch. Hopefully by some stroke of luck this doesn't prove to be necessary, but I'll expect the worst.</p>
		<p><span style="color:red">[UPDATE: All of the Discord messages documenting the development process will be archived and be put up for download. I recognize that Discord is about the worst place you could keep important information like this, and I'm changing the way that I'll manage this information in the future. Thank you.]</span></p>
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<p>There's nothing here! Why? Because the game is in such an early state that there's nothing worth posting here! Of course, I COULD put some images of the game, but it isn't very pretty. And who wants to see that? Then again, this website isn't exactly winning any beauty contests...</p>
