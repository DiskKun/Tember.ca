    <h1>Ten Pieces of Software People Should Really Check Out</h1>
    <p>By: Lucas Hourahine</p>
    <p>The following is a small list I have curated containing 10 (ten) pieces of software you might want to look into. Some of these are video games, others are neat open-source projects, some are just fun CLI-tools. Please note that while the list is numbered I am not ranking the software.</p>
    <h2>10. Minicraft</h2>

    <p>I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you read that as Minecraft the first time. I know I did. This game was actually originally developed by Markus Persson (AKA Notch, the creator of Minecraft) during a 48-hour game-development competition. He doesn't develop the game anymore, but since it's open-source, the game has been picked up by developers and Minicraft+ was released soon after. Minicraft+ is still getting updates, and recently was given a multiplayer server mode. The game is free for download at <a href="https://playminicraft.com">playminicraft.com</a>. Give it a try!</p>
    <h2>9. SSH-Chat and SSHTalk</h2>

    <p>These are among the coolest of things on this list. The first, SSH-Chat, is chat server software that runs over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>. Secure Shell is normally used for accessing computers remotely, however, SSH-Chat takes over the protocol and transmits chat data instead! The best part about this software is that you don't even need to download it to start chatting; you can just fire up a command prompt / terminal and type "ssh ssh.chat" and off you go. Most people percieve the software's room limitation (that being that the software only has one "room" per server) as a con, but SSH-Chat's creator <a href="https://github.com/shazow/">Shazow</a> (and myself) are strong believers that the majority of what makes SSH-Chat uniquie is it's community, which would not exist if it weren't for this so-called "limitation." If you want to run your own instance of SSH-Chat, you can view it on <a href="https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>SSHTalk, on the other hand, is a similar concept executed in an entirely different way. Hand-written in assembly (yes, you read that right), this is a much more advanced piece of software than SSH-Chat. This features user-registration, multiple chat rooms, real-time typing (more on that in a bit), a fancy ANSI "GUI", spinning cursors, and most importantly, an intro-animation. This is a crazy accomplishment, and is most impressive. However, there is one place where SSHTalk falls short of SSH-Chat: the community. SSHTalk <i>very rarely</i> sees active users, where SSH-Chat has a rotating userbase of about 20 at any given time. This seems miniscule in today's age of massive Discord servers and social media platforms with millions of users.</p>
