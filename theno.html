    <h1>The No</h1>
    <p>Donald said to Joseph "Einstein would fact" and then Justin intervened with a "ual evidence that" so my dear friend Elizabeth told to them "boys you must not" however there was an unfortunate circumstance involving George who told to me "three i have sought."
And so this concludes the beginning of a tail of a lion who would roar his engine on his way to the race of humanity. And so this commences the beginning of a new story that will be ran from East to South, North to West. South by Southwest. North by Northeast. South by Southeast. North by Northwest.
So there is no reason to save the life of no, for it was never alive in the first place. Enjoy yourselves, enjoy the wine.</p>
    <p>Give me days! All hear, hear hear, give the days me to the days. And there it was, there it was, it was. It acted in such a violent mood, and it gave me such bright feelings. Joy is subjective, they say, they say, but no no no woman nor man nor computer will ever tell you otherwise. That goes for you as well, END OF DAYS, BE THE END.
So tell me then, what goes into the great artwork that we erect ourselves over? It certainly is not a suitable audience for the horrors of the late nineties... Or was I mistaken? There were three hundred of them last I remembered. It is such a shame to think about their lives, which will never be found.

So is it lost if it was never meant to be found?
Is it lost if nobody cares?
Who cares?
Not me.

So there we were, giving days to me, but the days went by. And so did the car, as it crushed the crossing bear. It drives on, as they say. So then the no will pick up the remains and keep it all to themselves. Who is it? Why do they do this? I hope we find out soon, and I hope it remains a mystery forever.</p>
